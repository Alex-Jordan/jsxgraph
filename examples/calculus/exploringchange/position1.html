        <p>
            To talk about your position along a line in mathematics is to give the distance and direction
            from the starting point to point Me. To calculate your distance along a horizontal line, you subtract
            the x-coordinates of your points.
        </p>
        <p>
            Measure the x-coordinate of point Me. To calculate the difference <tt>x<sub>Me</sub> - x<sub>Home</sub></tt>
            <a href="javascript:board.create('text', [2, 0.5, function() { return '<tt>x<sub>Me</sub> - x<sub>Home</sub> = ' + (me.X() - home.X()).toFixed(2) + '</tt>';}])">click
            here</a>. Additionally <a href="javascript:me.setProperty({trace: true});">turn on tracing</a> for point Me and drag along your line.
        </p>
        <p>Questions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Can you see your path?</li>
            <li>What happens to your Position measurement when you are at a location left of point Home? Right
                of point Home? When you are at point home?
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The measurement <tt>x<sub>Me</sub>-x<sub>Home</sub></tt> is called a <i>directed distance</i> because it gives
            both the distance and direction between the two points.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your trace gives a reasonable model of your path, but it is limited to one dimension. If you look at this trace
            at the end of the day, can you tell what you did? If you traveled back and forth at all, some information was
            lost. A better model is a position plot, which uses time to expand this line into two dimensions by plotting
            position versus time. Time is simulated here by the x-coordinate of a point moving on an axis.
