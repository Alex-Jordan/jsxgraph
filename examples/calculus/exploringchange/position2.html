<h1>Exploring Change: Position</h1>

<p><strong>Here goes some introductory text.</strong></p>

    <div style="width: 800px;">
        <p>
            The first new thing here is the time axis. A point Time was created and it's x-coordinate represents the
            current time of day. The also new point P represents time versus position. It's x-coordinate is the time,
            and the y-coordinate is your position.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this first trial, you won't move point Me at all. Questions:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                What kind of position trace do you think you'll get if point Me just sits there and point Time moves?
                (Think! How is your distance from home changing if you stay in your bed as the minutes tick by?)
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Check your answer by pressing the Animate button and observe.
        </p>
        <p>
            After examining your trace (was it what you expected?) press the Reset button.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now drag point Me while point Time moves. Point P will plot your position with respect to time. You can drag
            point Me any way you wish, but try each of these suggested movements as well. Each time, draw a little sketch
            of your trace in the margin and make a note of what you did to get that trace. Remember to press Reset when
            you want to try a new motion.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Drag point Me at a steady pace to your friend's house (try not to vary your speed at all), stay for about
                an hour, and then go home at a steady pace.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>... some more scenarios ...</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Make a variety of traces, and look for relationships between how you move the point and the resulting trace.
            Questions:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                How must you drag point Me to make the directed distance (position) measurement increase? What happens
                on the trace when you do this? (Remember that going from -2 to -1 is an increase.)
            </li>
            <li>
                How must you drag point Me to make the directed distance (position) measurement decrease? What happens
                on the trace when you do this?
