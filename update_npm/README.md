JSXGraph
========

JavaScript library for interactive math visualizations in the web browser.

About
-----

*JSXGraph* is a cross-browser library for interactive geometry, function plotting,
charting, and data visualization in a web browser. It is implemented completely
in JavaScript, does not rely on any other library, and uses SVG, canvas, or even the venerable VML.
*JSXGraph* is easy to embed and has a small footprint: approx. 160 KByte if
embedded in a web page. No plug-ins are required! Special care has been taken
to optimize the performance.

*JSXGraph* supports multi-touch events and runs on all major browsers, even on very old IEs.

*JSXGraph* is developed at the
Lehrstuhl f√ºr Mathematik und ihre Didaktik
University of Bayreuth, Germany
