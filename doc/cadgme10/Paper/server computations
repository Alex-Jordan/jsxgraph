JSXGraph includes a math library which provides some basic algorithms, e.g. linear equation and ode solvers. For more complex calculations, like
groebner basis computation or fast fourier transformation, it is also possible to use other math libraries and tools together with JSXGraph. This
is done by using a JavaScript object named XMLHttpRequest. This object is intended for loading data from a web server (a)synchronously via JavaScript
without having to reload the whole web page. It can be used to send data to a web server, too.

In conjunction with JSXGraph this means that JSXGraph can be used as a graphical control tool, i.e. the user can choose the input parameters e.g. by
dragging points. JSXGraph then sends the coordinates to a web server where a CGI script is run which invokes the program which does the calculations.
The CGI script then grabs the results and sends them back to the users' web browser displaying them using JSXGraph.

Usually this is bound with a bunch of programming work, too. Hence, JSXGraph provides a client/server interface to ease the integration of server side
calculations.
