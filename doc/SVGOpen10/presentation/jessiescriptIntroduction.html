<ul>
<li>Having to program everything with JavaScript to display math with JSXGraph is a hurdle for using it in classroom with students.</li>
<li><b>Alternative:</b>JessieScript</li>
<li>JessieScript was invented at the university of Bayreuth and is a syntax similar to what is taught in schools and can be parsed by JSXGraph.</li>
<li><b>Examples:</b> <br>P(1,1); Q(-2,2); g=[PQ]; k(P,2); M=1/2(P,Q); ||(g,M); f:x^2+2*x-3;</li>
<li>Easy to learn and use</li>
<li><b>Additional positive aspect:</b><br> No neccessity to let a user write JavaScript code to produce constructions, i.e. it is possible to let any user provide constructions e.g. in a wiki in a secure way because everything gets parsed by JSXGraph.
